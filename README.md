# The Odin Project

Hello Everyone! I just finished my landing page project. I was planning on doing something simpler so I could move on with the course but then i got the idea of doing a recruitment page for the Star Wars Empire and it was unbelievably fun. Page is a non-responsive one (working on it!) and any kinda of feedback will be very much appreciated.
