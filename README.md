>  After finishing up these three first lessons I had everything set up to start coding, and moving from mouse clicking to doing almost everything at the Linux Terminal was a challenging, but very welcoming experience.

> After finishing the HTML, CSS and Flexbox lessons, together with all the exercises included in them I fell confident enough to build any kind of webpage using those languages. Seeing how much I can do with HTML and CSS alone I can't imagine what can be done when you use other languages with and I can't wait to find out!!!
